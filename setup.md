title: Setup
---

Please try to complete the following setup tasks ahead of the lesson. 

## Create appropriate SAFE accounts

<p>
Course attendees should have received instructions on how to
set up an Archer SAFE account. Details are available at the
<a href="https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/">Archer2
web site</a>.
</p>

<p>
This will allow you to obtain a machine account which will be used for
the course. (If you already have a machine account, it is possible to
use that, although you may not have access to the course queue
reservation.)
</p>

<p>
Any problems encountered will be addressed as the first part of the course.

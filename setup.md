title: Setup
---

Please try to complete the following setup tasks ahead of the lesson. 

## Create appropriate SAFE accounts

Course attendees should have received instructions on how to set up an Archer SAFE account.
Details are available in the [ARCHER2 documentation][archer2-quickstart].

This will allow you to obtain a machine account which will be used for the course.
(If you already have a machine account, it is possible to use that, although you may not have access to the course queue reservation.)

Any problems encountered will be addressed as the first part of the course.

## LAMMPS resources

The [LAMMPS manual](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html) is, in my opinion, a 
very well written manual with a lot of information about the various 
functionalities of LAMMPS. It is my go-to when I want to learn how to run a 
LAMMPS command, or when I want to understand how LAMMPS implements a specific 
functionality.

In this manual, there is a handy [How-to](https://docs.lammps.org/Howto.html) 
section. You can find a number of tutorials in there for understaning and 
running various simulations.

The [LAMMPS example scripts](https://docs.lammps.org/Examples.html) that come 
with the source code are an excellent source of inspiration and a great 
starting point for testing ideas. When I want to understand how to use a 
function, I will check whether there is an exercise that uses said function 
and use that as a template to get my system to work.

Finally, there is the [LAMMPS mailing list](https://matsci.org/c/lammps/40). 
You can post questions to this list to have them answered by other members of 
the LAMMPS community and by the LAMMPS developers. A lot of repeat questions 
get asked there, so before you post your question, have a look through the 
records to check that someone has not already asked it.

## ARCHER2 resources

If you attended the live course, you will retain access to your `ta058` 
account (with a small amount of budget) for a couple of months following the 
course. This is to allow you to make sure that you understood all of the 
course materials and have an opportunity to run any of the exercise 
simulations that you did not have time to complete in the training lesson. 
This is also to let you test out your own simulations on ARCHER2.

If you have any questions about using ARCHER2, the first port of call is the 
[ARCHER2 manual](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/). This manual covers a number of 
aspects of using ARCHER2, from the more simple ""ow to I get a program to run" 
to the more complex "How can I debug my software efficiently on a 
supercomputer".

If you cannot find the answer to your question, please contact the ARCHER2 
support team by email at support@archer2.ac.uk.

## ARCHER2 Training

There is lots of training matieral available through the ARCHER2 service 
covering many different topics and to suit many different levels of 
experience. 

Details of courses, the upcoming schedule and information on how to register 
can be found in the 
[ARCHER2 training pages](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/).

You can also find course material (and sometimes recordings) for previous 
ARCHER2 courses in the 
[ARCHER2 course repository](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/materials/)

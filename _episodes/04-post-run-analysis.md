## LAMMPS reruns

In this section of the the course, we will be spending some time exploring the LAMMPS `rerun` functionality.
This is an oft overlooked functionality that, when used correctly, can save a significant amount of compute time.

The LAMMPS `rerun` command allows you to perform a pseudo-simulation from the outputs of a LAMMPS trajectory (or dump) file.
Reruns are easy to set up, especially if you have a copy of the simulation script that was used to generate the trajectory file being used, and are quick and inexpensive to run.

Reruns can be used to:

  - Calculate thermodynamic properties of the system that were overlooked or not calculated in the initial simulation.
  - Compute system properties (e.g. radial distribution functions, mean square displacement) using LAMMPS computes once the simulation is complete.
  - Compute thermodynamic properties of a system as if it had been run using a different potential.
  - Compute properties of a system that would have been costly to compute during the initial run.

In this section, we will explore how to use this functionality and its associated restrictions.

## Exercise: Running a LAMMPS simulation from a trajectory file

For this course, we have prepared a number of exercises.
If you have not done so yet, you can get a copy of these exercises by running (make sure to run this from `/work`):

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://www.github.com/EPCCed/archer2-advanced-use-of-lammps.git
cd exercises/2-post-analysis/
```

Once this is downloaded, please `cd exercises/2-post-analysis/`. In this directory you will find three files:

  - `in.lj_start` is a LAMMPS input script to simulate a small Lennard-Jones gas and generate a LAMMPS trajectory file.
  - `in.lj_rerun` is a LAMMPS input script for running a simulation from the LAMMPS trajectory file generated by running `in.lj_start`
  - `run.slurm` is the Slurm submission script that will let us run our initial simulation.

To run the initial `in.lj` simulation, run:

```bash
sbatch run.slurm
```

The simulation will generate a LAMMPS trajectory file called `nvt.lammpstrj` that we will be using to run our `rerun` simulation.

You can run the `rerun` simulation from the serial nodes as this is a quick, not computationally intensive simulation that can be run on a single core.
To run the rerun simulation, comment the first `srun` command and uncomment the second one.

In this example, we are using this rerun to generate two new bits of information:

  - We are outputting a number of new thermodynamic outputs with our `thermo_style` command.
  - We are generating a radial distribution function (RDF) of the system.

> ## Exploring RDF outputs
> 
> In `in.lj_rerun`, the RDF is being calculated every 100 timesteps.
> What happens if you calculate it every 500 timesteps instead?
> What about every 50 timesteps?
>
> NOTE: For the `fix ave/time` command, the first number defines the frequency at which snapshots are taken
> (i.e. how many timesteps elapse between each snapshot),
> the second number defines how many snapshots are taken, and the third number defines over how many timesteps averages should be calculated.
> For this exercise, you will want to keep the third number constant, and ensure that the product of the first and second numbers equals the third.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > Setting the snapshot frequency to 500 instead of 100 results in a similar (if perhaps noisier) RDF.
> > 
> > Setting the snapshot frequency to 50, however, results in no RDF being output.
> > This is because the `nvt.lammpstrj` LAMMPS trajectory had atom positions output every 100 timesteps.
> > LAMMPS cannot calculate what happened during the interim timesteps.
> > 
> > This is one of the limitations of the `rerun` command:
> > you will only get information from what you feed into it (unsurprisingly).
> > However, even with that, it is a very powerful command.

> ## Changing the potential
> 
> So far in this exercise, we have been using a truncated Lennard-Jones potential.
> What happens to the energy when the truncation distance is changed?
> 
> You can change the truncation distance by altering the `pair_style lj/cut 3.5` command.
> What happens to the total energy (`etotal`) when you change the truncation distance from 3.5 sigma to 2.5 sigma?
> What about if you change it to 1.5 sigma?
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > The total energy of the system should not change very much if the pairwise particle interactions are truncated at a distance of 2.5 sigma instead of 3.5 sigma.
> > When the cutoff distance is dropped to 1.5 sigma, however, the energy should be noticeably different.
> > This indicates that a distance of 2.5 sigma is "good enough" for truncating these Lennard-Jones interactions, but that a distance of 1.5 sigma is not.

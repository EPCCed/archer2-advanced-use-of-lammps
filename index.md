<h2>Description</h2>

This lesson provides an overview of some more advanced techniques and uses of 
LAMMPS. Specifically, we will be discussing:
  - Measuring and improving LAMMPS performance
  - Using LAMMPS with Python
  - Analysing systems through reruns
  - Advanced sampling methods with a focus on replica exchange

For this lesson, we expect attendees to be familiar with LAMMPS. We will *not* 
be covering how to prepare and run a parallel LAMMPS simulation (and we will 
assume that all attendees know how to do that already). This lesson is aimed 
at anyone who:
  - has experience using `bash` (or any other shell)
  - has experience running LAMMPS on multiple processors
